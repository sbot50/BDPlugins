### Just a very simple plugin to enable the experiments tab on discord,
### when installed exit discord settings and go in it again, you should see the experiments tab under What's New.
### You may need to restart discord if you don't see it.
### I suggest to only use this to re-enable april fools jokes, since most experiments aren't well documented.
